# alexa-skill-Market-Teller

This is an Alexa skill I wrote to retrieve market information.  It only has very basic functionalities and it isn't connected up to a database, but I wrote it so that it could serve as a baseline should anyone want to work on it without having to worry about session management.  It uses the new Alexa-sdk module for Node.JS.  

Example:

Q: What is the spread on apple ten year?
A: The spread for Apple ten year is 40.

Q: What is the spread for apple?
